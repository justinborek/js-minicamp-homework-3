Objects - Objects are a variable that allows you to store different properties about it, that can then
be easily accessed individually or as a group. For example, if I wanted to create myself in a program,
I could do a bunch of variables like justinName, justinAge, justinEmail, and so on. Instead, I could
create a justin object with the properties name, age, email, etc. which keeps the code much more
organized. This can also be used for groups of objects where you may collect lots of the same type,
like users.

Properties - Properties are the values associated with an object. In the example above, name, age,
email would be the properties. Properties can be easily accessed individually from outside the object.

Methods - Methods are actions that can be performed on an object. They can be built in methods such as
toUpperCase, which converts all the characters of a string to uppercase, or they can be methods that
you create by attaching a function to a property of the object.

For In loops - The for-in loop simply loops through all properties of the object. It activates the line
of code contained in the loop once for each property contained in the object.

Dot vs. Bracket notation - Dot notation and bracket notation are two different ways to access an
object's properties. For example, object.property would access the same thing as object['property'].
Dot notation can be easier to read, however it cannot be used with variables or numbers. In that case,
bracket notation would be preferred.
